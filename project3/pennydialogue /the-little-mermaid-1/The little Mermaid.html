    <h6 href="">Triton: You went up to the surface again, didn't you? Didn't you?!</h6>

    <h2 href="">Ariel: Nothing happened.</h2>


    <h3 href="">Triton: Ariel, how many times must we go through this? You could've been seen by one of those barbarians. By... By one of those... humans!</h3>


   <h2 href="">Ariel: Daddy, they're not barbarians!</h2>


   <h3 href="">Triton: They are dangerous! Do you think I want to see my youngest daughter snared by some fish-eater's hook?!</h3>


   <h4 href="">Ariel: I'm 16 years old! I'm not a child anymore!</h4>


    <h3 href="">Triton: Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady! As long as you live under my ocean, you'll obey my rules!</h3>

    <h2 href="">Ariel: But if you would just listen!</h2>
    

    <h6 href="">Triton: Not another word! And I am never, never to hear of you going to the surface again! Is that clear?!</h6>

   <h6 href="">Triton: I consider myself a reasonable merman. I set certain rules and I expect those rules to be obeyed.</h6>

    <h2 href="">Ariel: But Dad, I...!</h2>


    <h3 href="">Triton: Is it true you rescued a human from drowning?!</h3>


   <h4 href="">Ariel: Daddy, I had to.</h4>


   <h6 href="">Triton: Contact between the human world and the mermaid world is strictly forbidden! Ariel, you know that! Everyone knows that!</h6>


   <h4 href="">Ariel: He would've died! </h4>


    <h3 href="">Triton: One less human to worry about.</h3>

    <h2 href="">Ariel: You don't even know him!</h2>
    

    <h3 href="">Triton: Know him? I don't have to know him! They're all the same: Spineless, savage, harpooning fish-eaters, incapable of any feeling.</h3>


     <h4 href="">Ariel: Daddy, I love him!  </h4>


    <h3 href="">Triton: No. Have you lost your senses completely?! He's a human! You're a mermaid!</h3>

    <h4 href="">Ariel: I don't care!</h4>
    

    <h3 href="">Triton: So help me, Ariel, I am going to get through to you. And if this is the only way, so be it!</h3>
